# Machine Learning course

This repository hosts the report for our practical works, as well as the report and code of a project I completed with another student during my master's course in machine learning (https://dac.lip6.fr/master/ml/).


## Practical Works (TME)

### [TME 1: Decision Trees, Model Selection](https://github.com/pictoune/ML/blob/main/Practical%20works/instructions_TP_1.pdf)
- Focus on hierarchical classification models using decision trees.

### [TME 2: Linear Models](https://github.com/pictoune/ML/blob/main/Practical%20works/instructions_TP_2.pdf)
- Introduction to linear models and implementation of a perceptron.
- Experimentation with the United States Postal Service (USPS) dataset for handwritten digit recognition.

### [TME 3: Kernel Methods](https://github.com/pictoune/ML/blob/main/Practical%20works/instructions_TP_3.pdf)
- Exploration of kernel methods for density estimation and regression.
- Implementation of Kernel Density Estimation and Nadaraya-Watson estimator.

### [TME 4: Multi-Class Learning](https://github.com/pictoune/ML/blob/main/Practical%20works/instructions_TP_4.pdf)
- Implementation of multi-class learning methods: One-versus-one and One-versus-all.
- Experimentation with string kernels.

### [TME 5: Neural Networks](https://github.com/pictoune/ML/blob/main/Practical%20works/instructions_TP_5.pdf)
- Implementation of a neural network inspired by early versions of PyTorch.
- Experimentation with multi-class classification and mini-batch stochastic gradient descent.

## Project - Neural Networks: DIY
- The objective was to implement a modular neural network.
- The implementation is inspired by early versions of PyTorch and similar implementations allowing for very modular generic networks.
