# Machine Learning course

This repository presents the practical works and a project I completed (with another student) as a part of my master's course in machine learning (https://dac.lip6.fr/master/ml/).


## Practical Works (TME)

### [TME 1: Decision Trees, Model Selection](./TME1)
- Focus on hierarchical classification models using decision trees.

### [TME 2: Linear Models](./TME2)
- Introduction to linear models and implementation of a perceptron.
- Experimentation with the United States Postal Service (USPS) dataset for handwritten digit recognition.

### [TME 3: Kernel Methods](./TME3)
- Exploration of kernel methods for density estimation and regression.
- Implementation of Kernel Density Estimation and Nadaraya-Watson estimator.

### [TME 4: Multi-Class Learning](./TME4)
- Implementation of multi-class learning methods: One-versus-one and One-versus-all.
- Experimentation with string kernels.

### [TME 5: Neural Networks](./TME5)
- Implementation of a neural network inspired by early versions of PyTorch.
- Experimentation with multi-class classification and mini-batch stochastic gradient descent.

## Project - Neural Networks: DIY
- The objective was to implement a modular neural network.
- The implementation is inspired by early versions of PyTorch and similar implementations allowing for very modular generic networks.
